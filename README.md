An implementation of Multi-channel Distance Fields in Rust-Vulkan. Distance fileds were generated with [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen).

This is a very rough test just to try the technique so the code is pretty basic - there's no window resize handling, no robust error management, no cleaning.
